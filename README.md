* Towards the end of this study, I was included in an on-going research project supervised by Dr. Daniela Inclezan & Dr. Marcello Balduccini. 
* My prior responsibility was to develop the Question Answering component in logic forms on 'Understanding Restaurant Stories using ASP theory of Intentions'. 
* My future goal is to reserach, design and develop natural language translation from narratives in English to history & observations in ASP and apply similar transformations for the Question Answering component.

Request to view my contributions in this project will be handled on a case by case basis.
