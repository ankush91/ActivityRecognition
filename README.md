* Primary Advisor: Dr. Marcello Balduccini, Drexel Univeristy, mb3368@drexel.edu | marcello.balduccini@gmail.com
* External Advisor: Dr. Daniela Inclezan, Miami University, daniela.inclezan@gmail.com

# Folder Organization

* The respective folders contain papers read and researched upon as part of the study. Please note that the papers were a focus of academic research and discussion and as a consequence most of the relevant citations have not yet been included in this repository.  <br>
* The 'MyPresentations' folder is a key folder which contains presentations on some important papers which were formed a basis of significant insights and discussions as part of my study.

# Outcome

* Towards the end of this study, I was included in an on-going research project supervised by Dr. Daniela Inclezan & Dr. Marcello Balduccini. 
* My prior responsibility was to develop the Question Answering component in logic forms on 'Understanding Restaurant Stories using ASP theory of Intentions'. 
* My future goal is to reserach, design and develop natural language translation from narratives in English to history & observations in ASP and apply similar transformations for the Question Answering component.
* Please note that the current version of this work (code & paper) is under consideration for publication under 'International Conference of Logic Programming, 2017' and is not included as part of this repository. Request to view my contributions in this project will be handled on a case by case basis.
